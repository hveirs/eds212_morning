## Leslie Matrix Example

Matrix model of population changes using the example we have from lecture.

Note: "Render" is the same as "knitr" 

```{r}
insect_leslie <- matrix(
  data = c(0, 0, 600, 0.2, 0, 0, 0, 0.08, 0), 
  nrow = 3, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

```

Create initial conditions to do matrix multiplication
```{r}
insect_y0 <- c(12000, 700, 500)

# the operator %*% means dot product and matrix multiplication
insect_y1 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y0

```

Estimate populations at each life stage at year 2 and 3

```{r}
insect_y2 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y1

insect_y3 <- insect_leslie %*% insect_y2
```
